## Working with Rhyd

I help software development teams create outstanding products and services. I have consulted as a product and delivery manager for government, fintech, and telecommunications companies.

I lead by example and enjoy helping empowered, self-organising teams produce their best work. I am an advocate of all things agile, lean and systems thinking-related. My goal is to make the software and product development process clear to understand, focused on value and enjoyable for everyone involved.

### How it works

You can schedule a free, exploratory call with Rhyd to discuss your situation and any outcomes or problems you want to solve. [Get in touch](mailto:rhyd@hey.com) today to find out more about how Rhyd can help your company achieve more.
