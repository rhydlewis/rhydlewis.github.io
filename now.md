## Right now...

I'm spinning these plates at the moment:

- reading the brilliant book ["Co-Intelligence" by Ethan Mollick](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/460207/co-intelligence-by-mollick-ethan/9780753560778)
- rebuilding this site
- writing & recording an original song - it is taking waaaaaay too long
- sitting on a new entMOOT song
- recording a couple of covers
- thinking about a new podcast idea (and how to make it happen)
- working at [Equal Experts](https://www.equalexperts.com)
- training for the Paris & Manchester Marathons. Still a year away but training has definitely begun
