I gave a talk about the benefits of Slack at a [Sullivan & Stanley](https://www.sullivanstanley.com) internal event in July. Here's a blogified version of the talk - enjoy!

## Synopsis

* How I introduced Slack as a useful tool at a previous company
* Why it became an important part of our workflow
* How it helped us do more

By the end of this post, you should know more about some of the benefits and drawbacks Slack could offer to your company.

## Background

In 2014, I was working at a consultancy that helped companies and organisations solve difficult software problems. Communication was  - and still is - paramount. As a distributed team, we tried using messaging and office collaboration tools like Yammer, Skype and Google+ but none of these seemed felt right.

Whilst working at a financial publishing client, our team - a mix of consultants and employees - had difficulty using a viable collaboration tool. As consultants, we couldn't access the client's internal messaging apps and tools like Skype were explicitly blocked by the company.

Enter [Slack](www.slack.com), just at the right time. This new app - around for less than a year - was already getting positive news. We installed it, we tried it and we liked it: it solved some of our problems straight away. I created a workspace for my company to use and within a few weeks we had 10 users and within 6 months, 130 had signed up.

## Why Slack worked

So, why did Slack succeed where other tools failed? The stand out reasons for me are:

- easy to install and start using
- lack of connectivity hassle
- it didn't feel corporate or boring - it was fun to use
- it allowed us to stay in touch without hassle, there was no admin controlling the set up so conversations and groups could grow organically

People started to set up specific groups to:

- share status updates across the company/teams
- keep in touch with distributed colleagues
- start team discussions
- talk about social, fun non-work topics

Then people realised we could use it to help us:

- promote fund raising and corporate responsibility actions
- create and share help, how-to, FAQs content
- set up communities of practice to help people in similar roles working for different clients help each other
- receive alerts from CI pipelines and build monitors
- play games and get feedback using polls
- improve our hiring and interview
- co-ordinate our sales effort
- easily integrate and receive updates from other apps and services

Some of the problems we observed included:

1. Slack gets noisy - fast. There is a lot of chatter so trying to keep up became pointless.
2. Slack stores your data on their servers which is a risk for some companies.

## Traits

Some of the traits people exhibit whilst using Slack can be funny too:

> Threads please!!!

* A cry for help from someone who can't keep up with a conversation. Keep an eye out for these people as they happily throw messages into the same channel later in flagrant disregard of their earlier decree

> @Dave I think your conversation with @Mike should be in #topic-that-is-of-no-interest-to-me-whatsover

- This person likes to tell other people that they should talk SOMEWHERE ELSE.

> @Sarah 🤬⚠️😱🧛‍♂️ - yeah?

- The person who uses emojis more than words

> lol

- Finally, my favourite, the person who only ever messages 'lol' in response to someone else

## 8 Reasons

So, here are the 8 ways Slack can help your company achieve more:

1. **improve support** - at a recent company, we reduced the lead time on support requests by giving our clients shared channel access in Slack. Direct and easy communication with customers is a winner
2. **build better client relationships** by bringing their people clients on board - again with shared channel access - to promote a single-team ethos where you can share progress, and good and bad news
3. keep colleagues past and present in touch **to improve cohesion**
4. help your teams **continuously improve** by setting up communities of practice to help people working in similar roles feel less isolated and to ask for help when they need it most
5. you can help your teams **maintain morale** - when the COVID lock down began earlier this year, people set up channels to help others discuss and deal with the sudden change to everyone's lives
6. find out when your **production systems are at risk** by integrating your monitoring tools into Slack. I've seen how alerts fed into Slack helped avoid production outages so they can be an absolute life saver.
7. **promote good news**:  new baby pictures, new joiners, etc.
8. **help recruitment effort** by posting new roles internally
