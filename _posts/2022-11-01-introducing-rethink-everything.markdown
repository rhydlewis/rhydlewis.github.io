I've started [my own podcast](https://rethinkeverything.show) which launches tomorrow! It aims to uncover the critical and defining moments in life that make people pause, reflect and rethink everything. 

Each week, I'll interview a guest to understand more about their life, their career and that moment that made them rethink everything.

It's been fun learning how to record, edit and produce each episode as well build a website and find a [hosting partner](https://play.acast.com/s/rethink-everything). Has taken me **much** more time than I expected but it's been enjoyable and hopefully people will find a good listen.
