Here's a summary of this week's notes, something I'm experimenting with for the foreseeable future...

### 🏃 Running

* Ran the Whitstable 10k on Monday in 55 mins dead. Not bad, but not a PB. 
* Early morning run on Weds and on Fri

### 🎸 Music

* Current WIP song:
  * sounds too muddy, I've got too much going on
  * rejigged lyrics, now I need to re-record
* Cover from a film soundtrack I started in 2020 is back on the front burner. Outline is there. Need to add guitars next.

### 📦 Projects

* Updated this site to fix some tagging snags and a quick mod to the About page
* Experimented with Hugo, Gatsby and 11ty as possible replacement static site generators. Not convinced it's worth the effort to migrate.

### 📤 Work

* Multiple iterations on a pitch to a potential client
* Travelled to Bristol for a co-working day

### 🤔 Also...

* Read [We Can Have a Different Web by Molly White](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/)
* Met Andy and family in the rain - lovely stuff
