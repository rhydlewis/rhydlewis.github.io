Notes for this week...

### 🏃 Running

* Running on Tuesday and Friday this week plus long run on Sunday
* Weeks til half marathon: 5

### 🎸 Music

* As per usual, I've parked work on 1 song to work on another... happy with the outline for it though and got a decent idea for a theme. Struggling with my vocal range though (what a surprise).
* Saw friends performing at an open mic and decided that I'd give it a crack too.

### 📦 Projects

* Created portfolio view of current commitments - 1 level up from my Personal Kanban board. 
* Play tested board game idea. Good feedback, v2 to follow.

### Other

* Trip out on Monday to the cinema
* Day trip on Thursday to London for all the activities with the boys: F1 Arcade, Shuffleboard, Ping Pong and Mini-Golf. Great fun.
