This week's most salient of notes...

### 🏃 Running

* Late Monday and early Wednesday runs this week with 1 more to do on Sunday

### 🎸 Music

* Current WIP song - haven't yet re-recorded vocals (I wonder why I put this off so much 🤔)
* Film soundtrack cover guitars added but sound rubbish. Back to the drawing board.

### 📦 Projects

* Continued with experiment with 11ty as possible replacement static site generator but have decided that it'll take too much time. To the 🗑️ with you.
* Experimented with Yearful as a tool to visualise the entire year

### 📤 Work

* 2 day course: Applying Scaled Portfolio Kanban
