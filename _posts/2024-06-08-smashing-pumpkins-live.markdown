I went to the O2 on Saturday night to see a gloriously effective show by Smashing Pumpkins. It's my 5th - I think? - trip to see them (quick check: 1996 Birmingham, 2005 Kentish Town Forum, 2013 Wembley, 2018 Wembley and... 2024 O2) and they were brilliant. 

I saw this headline ["Billy Corgan doesn’t want to play fan favourites at Smashing Pumpkins gigs: “I don’t care if they’re a classic or not"](https://www.nme.com/news/music/billy-corgan-doesnt-want-to-play-fan-favourites-at-smashing-pumpkins-gigs-3763187) and had some slight trepidation that they were going to play only Atum or Cyr songs. So, I was pleasantly surprised when they opened with The Everlasting Gaze and included bona fide classics such as Mayonaise, Today, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, Disarm and Rhinoceros.

A real treat.
