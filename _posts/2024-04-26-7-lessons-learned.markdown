Last night, I had the opportunity to present at a work event. The talk, titled "7 Lessons Learned During 2,500 Days Outside Equal Experts", seemed to be well-received by the audience. Over the past few weeks, I've been reflecting on my experiences, challenges and opportunities between 2017 and 2023. During this period, I worked for and with a number of companies, and through my reflections, I identified 7 lessons that I believe are relevant and valuable to me today. Some of these lessons might seem obvious, while others may be less apparent at first glance.

**#1 Lessons Learned Need a Pinch of Salt**
Approach advice and lessons learned with a healthy dose of skepticism. What works for 1 person may not work for another. Context is king so evaluate the relevance to your own circumstances.

**#2 Mediocre Leadership is the Norm**
Examples of poor leadership and how exceptional leaders are a rare beast. Recognizing the scarcity of brilliant leadership helped me appreciate and learn when I encounter them.

**#3 Culture Is Paramount (Until It's Not)**
How it's important to be mindful that company values and culture are not always sacrosanct (in some cases, they may be compromised when faced with competing priorities or external pressure).

**#4 Managing People Isn't as Easy as It Might Seem**
A couple of stories about my own foray into formal managerial roles and the complexity and challenges I faced.

**#5 Problems Aren't Always as Big as They Appear**
A [story](https://rhydlewis.net/blog/2023/2/16/is-your-problem-a-5-minute-problem) about the advice I received from an old boss that still resonates today. 

**#6 Escape Your Comfort Zone**
Stories and examples about leaning in and taking on challenges I would normally avoid. Told from a professional and personal point of view, these led to valuable experiences, skills and insights that I wouldn't have gained otherwise.

**#7 Life > Work**
How it's important — no matter how annoyed or frustrated work can be at times — to remember that life is more important. Keeping this perspective in mind has helped me deal with challenging situations and maintain a sense of balance.

Taking the time to think deeply about these lessons and articulate them in a meaningful way was rewarding. It allowed me to gain a clearer perspective on my professional journey over the last few years and some of the insights I've gained along the way. Afterwards, there were questions and positive feedback from a couple of attendees, which is always encouraging and appreciated. It's nice to know that sharing my experiences and lessons learned resonated with others.
