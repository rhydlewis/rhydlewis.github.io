I'm slightly late in shouting about it here but let's crack on shall we? I released a cover of the Tracy Chapman song "For My Lover" late last year. Very pleased with how it turned out.

Here's the full version:

And here's the instrumental version with an improvised guitar part replacing the singing:

The Logic Pro project ended up quite large - nearly a gig - so I think I've probably got some unused audio takes hanging around. Things I learned:

1. Mixing is painful - this is definitely not my forte.
2. Listening to your own voice played back repeatedly takes patience
3. Delay as an effect needs some TLC when thrown in
