<p class="lead">
Alright? I'm Rhyd, a consultant & musician based in Whitstable in the UK.
</p>

I'm a passionate guitarist, musician and consultant. Music has always been a driving force in my life, whether it's [**playing guitar & composing as myself**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4pIyMWReoHoNybLHAbzOGK?si=Qs6I9gZgQM26Wwnvt-3CYQ) or dabbling with synths and movie dialogue as my alter-ego, [**entMOOT**](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6HdybP67Hqp9kLsZeXvdgY?si=DtIY5UGHRL6VxmBEMnSemA). When I'm not trying to remember the notes of Gadd9 chord, I might be out for a slow run.

I'm fascinated by what makes people tick so I've been hosting the podcast [**Rethinking Work & Life**](https://rethinkingworklife.net). Although currently on a _slight_ hiatus, the show has been a platform for me to delve into the thinking and experiences of some brilliant individuals. I also maintain the moderately popular productivity [Alfred.app](https://alfred.app/) workflow, ["Search OmniFocus"](https://github.com/rhydlewis/alfred-search-omnifocus) which helps people quickly find and quickly access their [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) information.
